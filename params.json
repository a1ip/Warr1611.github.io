He and his wife, Shelly, have four children. He has been pastoring in Lexington, Kentucky for 25 years. He was saved at the age of twelve, raised in a godly home, and called to preach as a young man. He has a strong desire to take God's side in all that he does.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Salvation - Why\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Bible Way to Heaven:\r\n\r\n1. Recognize your condition. \r\nFor all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God. (Romans 3:23)\r\nNone of us is good enough to go to Heaven on our own merit. Because we are sinners, no matter how much good we do, we always fall short.\r\n\r\n2. Realize the penalty for sin. \r\nFor the wages of sin is death... (Romans 6:23a)\r\nJust as there are wages for good, there is punishment for wrong. The penalty for our sin is eternal death in a place called Hell.\r\n\r\n3. Believe Christ died for you. \r\nBut God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. (Romans 5:8)\r\nChrist showed His great love for us when He died on the cross to pay our sin debt.\r\n\r\n4. Trust Christ alone as your Saviour. \r\n...but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23b)\r\nFor whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. (Romans 10:13)\r\nEverlasting life is a gift purchased by the blood of Jesus and offered freely to those who call upon Him by faith. Let us help you word a prayer. (Realize that what saves is your faith in Jesus Christ, not saying mere words.)\r\n\r\nIf you will trust Jesus Christ as your Savior, pray a simple prayer. Prayer is simply talking to God. Tell Him that you know you are a sinner and that you deserve to pay your own sin debt. Acknowledge that Jesus died for you to pay the debt you owe, Today, as best as you know how, you will trust Him as your Savior. You will depend on Him from this moment on for your salvation. Ask God to help you live for Him and be a good Christian.\r\n\r\nIf you have trusted Jesus Christ to save you, please let us know by e-mail or you can call (859) 621-8569. We'd like to be sure you have a Bible and help you grow as a new Christian.\r\n\r\nOnce you are saved, you are saved for eternity. You cannot lose your salvation. No creature or thing can take it away from you.\r\n\r\nGod says: \r\nI give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish. (John 10:28)\r\n\r\nBut as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)\r\n\r\nTherefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. (2 Corinthians 5:17)\r\n\r\n\r\n# What We Believe - What\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Bible is the Final Authority\r\nWe believe that all scripture is given by inspiration of God (2 Tim. 3:16) and that God has promised to preserve His pure words (Ps. 12:6-7). We believe that the Authorized King James 1611 Bible is the inspired and preserved words of God in the English language and is therefore the supreme, inerrant, infallible, and final authority in all matters of faith, creeds, and conduct.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n### Salvation Comes by Grace Through Faith\r\nWe believe that salvation is a free gift of God (Eph. 2:8,9) offered to man by His grace and received by personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. It requires neither culture, character, religion, nor good works to get it or secure it. We believe every born again child of God is eternally secure in Christ with a forever sealed salvation (Eph. 1:13). Salvation will be evident through the fruit of repentance, faith, and newness of life (2 Cor. 5:17).\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n### The Godhead\r\nWe believe that there is only one living and true God (1 Tim. 2:5). He is an infinite, intelligent Person, the Maker and Supreme Ruler of Heaven and Earth (Deut. 4:39). In the unity of the Godhead, there are three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, equal in every divine perfection and executing distinct but harmonious offices in the great work of redemption (1Jn. 5:7).\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n### Jesus Christ\r\nWe believe that Jesus Christ is God (Jn. 1:1-3), He was born of a virgin (Is. 7:14), He was God manifest in the flesh (1Tim. 3:16), He lived a sinless life (Heb. 4:15), He laid down His life on the cross for our sins (Rom. 5:8), He arose bodily the third day (1Cor. 15:4), He ascended back to Heaven (Acts 1:9), He sits glorified at the right hand of the Father (Heb. 1:13), He is the Head of the Church (Col. 1:18), and He is coming again (Titus 2:13), and He is the only way to Heaven (Jn. 14:6).\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n### The Local Church\r\nWe believe the local church to be a body of believers who come together in obedience to Christ to carry out the dictates of the New Testament (Mt. 28:19, 20). The local church should be self-governing and independent from any interference of hierarchy, individuals, and organizations. Believers should assemble together locally in order to be edified in the word of God and to serve the Lord (Acts 11:23-26). The proper order for the local church is laid out especially in the Pastoral Epistles (1Tim. 3:15). Hope Baptist Church is an independent Baptist Church.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n### The Body of Christ\r\nWe believe that every believer in the Church Age is baptized by the Holy Spirit into the spiritual body of Christ upon salvation (1Cor. 12:13). We believe that the body of Christ was a great mystery that was hid from past ages until it was first revealed by Christ through the apostle Paul (Eph. 3:1-12). There is only one body (Eph. 4:4) of which Christ is the Head (Eph. 1:22-23). The body of Christ (the church) is a spiritual organism made up of all born-again Christians.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n### Baptism\r\nWe believe in following the Biblical pattern of baptism. Water baptism is only for those who have first believed in Jesus (Acts 8:37). It is full immersion into water symbolizing and identifying with the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ (Mt. 3:16). Baptism will also identify you with the local church. It is obedience to the Lord’s command (Mt. 28:19). Water baptism can in no wise impute grace or forgiveness of sins (1Cor. 1:17 & Rom. 4:24).\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n### The Lord's Supper\r\nWe believe the Lord’s Supper (“Communion”) to be a remembrance of what Christ did for us. The unleavened bread and fruit of the vine symbolize His body and blood. This special time of self-examination and appreciation allows us to not only look back, but also ahead to His coming (1Cor. 11:23-34). The elements in no way, shape, or form become supernatural, but are only symbolic.   \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n### Missions\r\nWe believe that the command to give the gospel to the world is clear and unmistakable (Mt. 28:19,20). It is the church’s clear responsibility to carry out this commission by sending forth those whom God has called. The equipping and supply of these missionaries is the sole duty of the church. Missions is the heartbeat of Hope Baptist Church.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n### Prophecy\r\nWe believe that Christ is coming secretly before the tribulation period for the members of His body. The dead in Christ will rise first and those that are alive will be “caught up” to meet Christ in the air (1Thes. 4:13-18). The blessed hope (Titus 2:13) of the body of Christ is distinct from the Second Coming of Christ back to the earth in judgment at the end of the tribulation period in order to set up His righteous kingdom (Rev. 19:11-16).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
